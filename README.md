| Folder / file | Purpose | Figure(s) |
| -------------- | ------- | -- |
| **`Transmission Simulations`** | Lumerical **MODE** projects for all 4 cases of the graded transition and all 4 temperatures | Fig. 1 & Fig. 6
| **`Wavelength_Dependant_Transmission_plots/`** | Wavelength‑dependent transmission curves | Fig. 3
| **`Tolerance/`** | Performance data (.mat) for ±5%, ±10% fabrication error and their plot code (.m) | Fig. 4
| **`E and H fields/`** | False‑colour plot exports of the electric and magnetic field snapshots at 1.55 µm | Fig. 5
| **`Dispersion/`** | Dispersion simulation file (.fsp), script to retrive time domain plots from the simulations (.lsf) as well as the exported data for MATLAB (.m and .mat) | Fig. 7
| **`LICENSE`** | MIT licence. |

Figures concerning those folders that have MATLAB files can be regenerated straight from `.m` files without the need to run the simulations.
